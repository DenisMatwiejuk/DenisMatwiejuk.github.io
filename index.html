                            Hi, I'm Denis Pawel Matwiejuk, I'm a graduate student hoping 
                            to become a games/software/web programmer in the future.

                        I started coding during highschool and ever since then I have always loved making games, applications 
                        and software. 
                         <br>
                        I have not made many of my projects public because I keep chaning them
                        or I switch to a different project because I hit a wall (mainly Art and 3D models).
                        So the only works I've made public are the ones that I made and finished during university,
                        they could still use some work though. 
                    </p>
                    <p class="main">
                        During my spare time, I enjoy programming games on unity and android applications
                        on android studio. I also play games such as WoW and Heroes of might and magic.

                    <p class="main">
                        I see myself working on huge amazing games in the future with talented teams (Than can draw and make 3D models).

                        Lokir's labyrinth is a Metroidvania type project done during my time at university.
                        The game was completed on the 10th of may 2018 and submitted as my final year project.
                        The game follows Lokir who is a adventurer that was heading towards a castle in atop a mountain when he
                        falls into a labyrinth from which he must find a way out.
                        <br><br>
                        The game was made using unity engine and can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/Lokirs_labyrinth" target="_blank">here </a>

                        Unnamed space shooter game is a attempt at a bullet hell game that was more wave based instead of having the player
                        continuously moving forward. The game follows the unnamed pilot as they are the last of their fleet to live
                        and must now find a way of defeating the enemy fleet alone.
                        <br><br>
                        The game was made using the Monogame engine and can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/TurnBasedSpaceShooter">here</a>
