                            Hi, I'm Denis Pawel Matwiejuk, I'm a recent graduate student hoping 
                            to become a games/software developer in the future.

                    <p class="main">
                        I started coding during highschool where my first project was to make a calculator
                         using JavaScript, since then I have expanded my knowledge in the field 
                         as well as learning other languages. The reason why I chose to study and pursue a career in the 
                         development field was video games; I played a lot of video games when I was younger, I loved them,
                         they told stories in ways books and movies couldn't, they let you be apart of the story. That is why I 
                         chose to be a developer, so I can help tell amazing stories and allow others to experience them in a way
                         no other media can.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        I haven't made many of my projects public because I only use basic shapes instead of drawn and animated characters
                        as that isn't something I'm able to do to a level I deem 'good'.
                        So the only works I've made public are the ones that I made and finished during university,
                        even though they could still use some work.<br>
                        Now that I've finished university and am currently looking for work I've had more spare time to work on side projects and
                        do more independent learning.
                        <br><br>
                        In the future I see myself working on large and small scale projects in game development, working with an amazing 
                        team, full of talented programmers and designers.

                        Lokir's labyrinth is a Metroidvania type project done during my time at university.
                        This game was made as my final year projects for university.
                        The game follows Lokir who is a adventurer that was heading towards a castle in atop a mountain when he
                        falls into a labyrinth from which he must find a way out.
                        <br>
                        The game was made using Unity engine and the source code can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/Lokirs_labyrinth" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        Blurgrio is a bullet hell game that is more wave based instead of having the player
                        continuously moving forward. The game follows the unnamed pilot as they are the last of their fleet to live
                        and must now find a way of defeating the enemy fleet alone.
                        <br>
                        The game was made using the Monogame engine and the source code can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/TurnBasedSpaceShooter" target="_blank">here</a>.
