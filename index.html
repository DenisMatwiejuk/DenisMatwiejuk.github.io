        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I started coding during highschool where my first project was to make a calculator
            using JavaScript, since then I have expanded my knowledge in the field 
            as well as learning other languages. The reason why I chose to study and pursue a career in programming
            was video games; I played a lot of video games when I was younger, and I've always wanted to develop them.
            <br><br>
            I haven't made many of my projects public as I'm comfortable with programming, I'm still trying to improve on
            drawing, modeling and animations.
            So the only works I've made public are the ones that I made and finished during university,
            even though they could still use some work.
            Now that I've finished university and am currently looking for work around the london area, 
            I've also had more spare time to work on my projects.
            I'm always looking for new challenges and new things to learn, in game development, I've beening 
            working with Unity since early 2017 and I've been loving it. I've also recently started learning 
            how to use the unreal engine.<br><br>
            In the future I see myself working on large and small scale projects as a game developer, working with an amazing 
            team, full of talented programmers and designers.
