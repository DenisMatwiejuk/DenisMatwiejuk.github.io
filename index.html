                            Hi, I'm Denis Matwiejuk, I'm a recent graduate student hoping 
                            to become a games/software developer in the future.

                    <p class="main">
                        I started coding during highschool where my first project was to make a calculator
                        using JavaScript, since then I have expanded my knowledge in the field 
                        as well as learning other languages. The reason why I chose to study and pursue a career in programming
                        was video games; I played a lot of video games when I was younger, and I've always wanted to develop them.
                         <br>
                         <br>
                        I haven't made many of my projects public as I'm comfortable with programming, I'm still trying to improve on
                        drawing, modeling and animations.
                        So the only works I've made public are the ones that I made and finished during university,
                        even though they could still use some work.
                        Now that I've finished university and am currently looking for work around the london area, 
                        I've also had more spare time to work on my projects.
                        I'm always looking for new challenges and new things to learn, in game development, I've beening 
                        working with Unity since early 2017 and I've been loving it. I've also recently started learning 
                        how to use the unreal engine.
                        <br><br>
                        In the future I see myself working on large and small scale projects as a game developer, working with an amazing 
                        team, full of talented programmers and designers.

                        Lokir's labyrinth is a Metroidvania type project done during my time at university.
                        This game was made as my final year projects for university.
                        The game follows Lokir who is a adventurer that was heading towards a castle in atop a mountain when he
                        falls into a labyrinth from which he must find a way out.
                        <br>
                        The game was made using Unity engine and the source code can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/Lokirs_labyrinth" target="_blank">here</a>.

                        Blurgrio is a bullet hell game that is more wave based instead of having the player
                        continuously moving forward. The game follows the unnamed pilot as they are the last of their fleet to live
                        and must now find a way of defeating the enemy fleet alone.
                        <br>
                        The game was made using the Monogame engine and the source code can be downloaded <a href="https://gitlab.com/Denisar/TurnBasedSpaceShooter" target="_blank">here</a>.
